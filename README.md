While the program was being developed, several websites were referenced for code structuring for some of the features implemented in the files. 
While creating the features that involve CSS, the webpages "CSS Introduction" and "CSS Buttons" were referenced (w3 schools, n.d.b; w3 schools, n.d.a).
While the developer was refreshing her memory of the SQL commands, she also referenced the webpage "Node.js MySQL" while contrstructing the queries (w3 schools, n.d.f).
While creating the sign-up form, the website "HTML <select> Tag" was referenced to properly format the drop-down menu (w3 schools, n.d.e).
In creating the checkboxes, the webpage "HTMP <input type="checkbox"> was referenced (w3 schools, n.d.c).
In creating the radio buttons for the law enforcement employee questionnaire, the developer referenced the webpage "HTML <input type="radio">" (w3 schools, n.d.d).
